# ChatGpt

The "ChatGPT+ ImageGen" project introduces a groundbreaking AI application that merges 
conversational chatbot functionalities with advanced image generation capabilities. The 
primary objective is to create an engaging user experience by facilitating natural conversations 
while simultaneously generating relevant images based on textual inputs. Leveraging state-ofthe-art deep learning techniques, the system integrates a fine-tuned GPT-based conversational 
AI and sophisticated generative adversarial networks (GANs) to ensure coherent and 
contextually-aware image synthesis.
